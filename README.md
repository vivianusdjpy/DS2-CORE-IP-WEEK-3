#SAMPLING PLAN AND SAMPLING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN


#OBJECTIVES

To help the government in staffing Immigration officers and Border Patrol Officers
To determine the most popular port of entry into the US between the US -Canada Border and the US-Mexico Border
To determine the rate of flow of people into the US through the US -Canada Border and the US-Mexico Border
The sample population will be used as a representative of the whole population


#DATA

The target population consists of persons entering the United States through two main (US-Canada Border and the US-Mexico Border) ports of entry out of the total 328 ports of entry. 
The target population represents data from 15 states.

 Date - The date and time of entry(1996 to 2018)
Measure- The mode of transport of the entrant(Conveyances, containers, passengers, pedestrians)
 Value -  Count
location-Longitude and Latitude Location


#SAMPLING FRAME

This sampling frame gives the rules and guidelines on how the sample should look
 like based on characteristics of the population.


#SAMPLING TECHNIQUES

#Cluster sampling 

level1:
The sampling method to be used is cluster sampling where the population will be divided into two clusters based on the Border used to cross into the US.
level2:
The second level of clusters will be based on the states, the two clusters will be classified further into countries 
Level3:
The third level of clusters will be based on the port name
Level4:
The last level of clusters will be based on the year of entry  that the data was recorded.
